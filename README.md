This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Biogen UI Test

The goal of this UI test was to create a navigation bar based on design that they provided in a Figma file.
Respecting these expectations:

1. Highlight the current nav item, and make sure the user nav can be toggled. The navigation doesn’t have to be pass all WCAG accessibility standards, but it would be amazing if Google Lighthouse didn’t find any accessibiity issues with it.

2. Do you think it’s clear enough that the user icon is clickeable? If no, how would you improve it?

3. Please make sure the nav communicates the current page the user is on, and that the user nav can be toggled with a click.

4. The developed nav doesn’t have to be responsive, though how would you prefer to design the mobile navigation? Nav items don’t have sub items just yet, but we need to prepare for having them. How would you show them on mobile?
